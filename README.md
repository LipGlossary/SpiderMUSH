## What is a MUTE?

In the long-standing tradition of MU\*s, MUTE stands for __m__ulti-__u__ser __t__ext __e__mpire/__e__nvironment. We have coined this term for MU\*s that are accessed via a modern web browser and may include non-command line features such as buttons, links, and other forms of input (e.g. forms).

## WinterMUTE

WinterMUTE is a browser-based MU* built with Node.

The intent is to return the joy of text-based virtual worlds and communal universe-building to the people through the use of modern tools. WinterMUTE should feel familiar to anyone who has Telnetted into a MU* but quickly grasped by anyone through the use of "command palettes" (buttons that invoke commands), input forms to replace multiple prompts for long arguments, and some version control.
