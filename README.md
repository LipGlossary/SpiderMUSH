# SpiderMUSH

SpiderMUSH is a browser-based MUSH built with Node.

The intent is to return the joy of text-based virtual worlds and communal universe-building to the people through the use of modern tools. SpiderMUSH should feel familiar to anyone who has Telnetted into a MU* but quickly grasped by anyone through the use of "command palettes."
